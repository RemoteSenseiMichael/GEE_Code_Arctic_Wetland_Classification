# GEE_Arctic_Wetland_Classification

This code, written using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API,  is for large-scale mapping of Arctic wetlands using multi-source Earth observation big data on GEE with machine learning (Random Forest algorithm). The code and methodology, which used Mahdianpari et al. (2021) as a baseline, tests both Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Pixel-Based Image Analysis (PBIA) techniques. This code is associated with the study titled: "Leveraging Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing for Large-scale Arctic Wetland Mapping". This work was conducted jointly through the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS), University of Guelph (UoG), and Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN).

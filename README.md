# GEE_Arctic_Wetland_Classification

This code is for large-scale mapping of Arctic wetlands using multi-source Earth observation big data on Google Earth Engine with machine learning (Random Forest). The methodology tests both Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Pixel-Based Image Analysis (PBIA) techniques. This code is associated with the study titled: "Leveraging Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing for Large-scale Arctic Wetland Mapping". This work was conducted jointly through the University of Guelph (UOG), Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), and the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS).
